Version 0.1.X - X/X/2024
************************
- MS1 input page now accepts a user input for "Adduct / duplicate" mass accuracy (Da or ppm) and retention time accuracy (min)
- MS1 workflow now correctly uses the user-defined mass and retention time accuracy parameters for identifying duplicate features
- Duplicate features are no longer automatically removed. They are kept in the "Results_flagged" sheet, flagged in the "Filter_documentation" sheet, and removed from the "Cleaned_feature_results_reduced" sheet.
- Tracer plots: Resolved an issue where if multiple tracer plots were generated, one of the tracer plots would be empty.
