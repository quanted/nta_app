NTA WebApp Version History and Known Issues Documentation
Version 0.3
Updated 9/9/2024

*************
Known Issues:
*************
1) MS1 workflow: If a tracer results file is selected but no run sequence file is selected, an error is thrown.
2) MS1 workflow: Features with a retention time of exactly 1 minute are being dropped from the results.
3) Decision tree: An MRL threshold is applied to the data even if blank samples do not meet the blank sample replicate threshold

************************

************************
Version 0.2.2 - 7/30/2024
************************
- MS2 workflow: Updated the input file parser to be more flexible when reading in MGF file formats.

************************
Version 0.2.1 - 7/15/2024
************************
- Fixed a bug causing the MS2 workflow page to not load
- MS1 results files: Various column names updated

************************
Version 0.2 - 6/26/2024
************************
- MS1 input page now accepts a user input for "Adduct / duplicate" mass accuracy (Da or ppm) and retention time accuracy (min)
- MS1 workflow now correctly uses the user-defined mass and retention time accuracy parameters for identifying duplicate features
- Duplicate features are no longer automatically removed. They are kept in both the "Results_flagged" and "Cleaned_features" sheets, flagged in the "Filter_documentation" sheet.
- Duplicate feature column ("Duplicate feature") added to the "Filter_documentation" sheet indicating whether a feature was identified as a duplicate.
- MS1 input page now accepts user input for "Blank MRL multiplier", values of 3, 5, 10 accepted.
- MS1 workflow now uses the user-defined blank MRL multiplier for calculating a blank MRL value.
- MS1 input page: Added user-selectable adducts for positive, negative and neutral loss adducts.
- MS1 workflow now uses the user-selected adducts for identifying adducts in the data.
- "Filter_documentation" sheet column "AnySamplesDropped?" now correctly references all three filters when identifying if any occurrence did not meet filter criteria.
- Tracer plots: Resolved an issue where if multiple tracer plots were generated, one of the tracer plots would be empty.
- Tracer plots: There is now an option to toggle between log and linear scale for the plot scaling.
- Tracer plots: There is now an option to toggle trendlines on/off on the plots.
- Tracer plots: General aesthetics updated (font sizes, titles, axes labels)
- CV Scatterplot: General aesthetics updated (font sizes, titles, axes labels)
- Occurrence heatmap: General aesthetics updated (font sizes, titles, axes labels)
- MS1 results file ToxCast percent active column: This column is now generating a correct value.
- MS1 results file "chemical_results" sheet now maps to all flagged features rather than filtered features.
- Adduct matching: The adduct matching columns are now referencing correct feature IDs as matches.
- Clean features function: Logic updated (object-oriented code).
- Clean features function: Resolved edge-case where feature with no data in any samples would pass all filter criteria.
- Logic tree v0.5.3: Icicle plots added to logic tree. Blank_MRL sliders added. Central table updated to group occurrences/features into Initial/Non-detects/Failed CV/Passed All groups for counting.
